# Netflix-Movies-and-TV-Shows-Clusturing
Using data preprocessing, PCA, K-means, hierarchical clustering, and a recommendation system, this project clusters Netflix content and evaluates results with key metrics like Silhouette Score, Calinski-Harabasz Score, and Davies-Bouldin Score.

## Project Steps

1. **Data Cleaning:** The dataset is cleaned, missing values are handled, and data quality is improved.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Statistical analysis and data visualization are performed to gain insights into the dataset.

3. **Textual Data Preprocessing:** Text data is preprocessed for NLP tasks.

4. **Dimensionality Reduction (PCA):** Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is used to reduce the dimensionality of the dataset.
