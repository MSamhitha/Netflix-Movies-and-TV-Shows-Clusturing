# Netflix-Movies-and-TV-Shows-Clusturing
Using data preprocessing, PCA, K-means, hierarchical clustering, and a recommendation system, this project clusters Netflix content and evaluates results with key metrics like Silhouette Score, Calinski-Harabasz Score, and Davies-Bouldin Score.

## Project Steps

1. **Data Cleaning:** The dataset is cleaned, missing values are handled, and data quality is improved.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Statistical analysis and data visualization are performed to gain insights into the dataset.

3. **Textual Data Preprocessing:** Text data is preprocessed for NLP tasks.

4. **Dimensionality Reduction (PCA):** Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is used to reduce the dimensionality of the dataset.

5. **Machine Learning Model Implementation:**
   - **K-means Clustering:** Implementation of K-means clustering.
   - **Hierarchical Clustering:** Implementation of hierarchical clustering.
   - **Recommendation System:** A recommendation system is implemented to provide personalized content recommendations.

6. **Evaluation Metrics:** Clustering quality is assessed using Silhouette Score, Calinski-Harabasz Score, and Davies-Bouldin Score.

## Clustering Techniques

Two different clustering techniques are applied to the dataset. 

## Recommendation System

A recommendation system is implemented to provide personalized content recommendations based on user preferences.

This project serves as a valuable step toward understanding user behavior, content management, and release strategies on the platform, ultimately benefiting both users and Netflix content providers.
